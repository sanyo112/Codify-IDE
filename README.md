# Codify-IDE
A web based IDE

The IDE was implemented using the basic web technologies. For the Windows platform a batch file is there which when executed checks for the installation of python 3 in the machine. If not found it first installs python 3 and continues with the starting of a portable python server. After the server is started it then triggers the main web page of the IDE to open. The main web page has all the functionalities of the IDE. On the startup it asks the user to either open an existing file or create a new one. These functionalities are achieved through the javascript and ajax calls to the python server. After creating the project the editor window is visible. Ace editor has been used for easy and effictive editing purposes. It provides the functionalities of syntax highlighting and correction recommendations. It also has code autocomplete feature. The other functionality to the IDE that we have added is the addition of custom snippet feature. What it does is the addition of any code parts, commonly and frequently used codes, or addition of a coded algorithm as specified with a particular name to the intellisense such that the next time user types the name given to that code snippet it appears in the code auto-complete and can be easily reused. Then comes the compile and run feature. It also sends the code via an Ajax call to the portable python server. This python server executes the required CGI scripts for that function. If the execution is successful then the output is displayed on the main web page otherwise the error is displayed.


The main advantage of Browser based IDE is its portability. The same package can be run on most of the present operating systems. The same IDE can be transferred to any other system without the hassle of initiating a new install or configuring any supportive tools. This IDE comes with  preconfigured settings which detect the compilers of various languages and auto configure the IDE settings according to that and even if python is not found on the system it automatically installs it silently without any user intervention. User can also run javascript as it is only dependent on the browsers javascript engine. Therefore it has built-in support for python and javascript.
